# Hexenhammer 
Your logical servitor

<small>It is better to die for the Emperor than live for yourself.</small>

## General
Welcome to the Hexenhammer! A Warhammer 40k Battle Calculator for determining a unit's efficiency.
Currently the hexenhammer is in development. So feel free to contribute in Form of Ideas, Code or bug reports!

### What is Hexenhammer?
Your logical servitor. This tool can help you planning your next matches,
evaluate your units, help you with buying decisions and provides a mathhammer functionality
to give you the best-in-breed warhammer tool for your desktop.

### How does it work?
Hexenhammer is a pure desktop application with a strong focus on easily accessible statistics.
We belive that a user can benefit a lot from just getting the data of his favourite units visualized.
In order to achieve this we use the simple input-process-output model. You enter your favorite units and 
weapons into the editor and choose how the data is filtered and presented to you.
